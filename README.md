# MOLD BUILDER
This is a simple python script I created to help me automate creating molds through immersive engineering for my modpack. 

### TO USE:
-Make sure you have python! this is a python script

-create a folder for minecraft 16x16 items you wish to create molds for, this will be your input folder.

-then designate an output folder for your molds. this is where your molds will be outputted to.

-create a mold builder class, or edit the one already bing used in molder.py and designate your input and output directories, as well as the mold_base and mold_nothing file provided.

-run and compile the python program, and get ready for mold!
