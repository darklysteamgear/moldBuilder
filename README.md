# MOLD BUILDER
This is a simple python script I created to help me automate creating molds through immersive engineering for my modpack. 

### TO USE:
1.) Make sure you have python! this is a python script

2.) create a folder for minecraft 16x16 items you wish to create molds for, this will be your input folder.

3.) Designate or create an output folder for your molds. this is where your molds will be outputted to.

4.) create a mold builder class, or edit the one already bing used in molder.py and designate your input and output directories, as well as the mold_base and mold_nothing file provided.

5.) run and compile the python program, and get ready for mold!
